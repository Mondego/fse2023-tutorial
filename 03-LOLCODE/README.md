## Part 1: Check the Foundation

Start by checking what the model already knows about LOLCODE, how often it fails, and why. Do this by feeding it the prompts above, taking the output, and feeding it to the online compiler/runner.

## Part 2: Design your Assistant

Think of how to design a prompt and/or a series of prompts and/or creating a reference dataset and/or ... that will make your assistant generate correct LOLCODE for any prompt (within the capabilities of LOLCODE, of course).

## Part 3: Evaluation

Think of how you would evaluate your assistant so that you and others can have a solid idea of its performance.
