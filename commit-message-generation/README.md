# GPT-4 Powered Commit Message Generator Tutorial

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will be introduced to a GPT-4 powered script designed for generating commit messages. You'll receive a CSV file containing 20 examples of code changes, which is essential for testing the script's capability in generating commit messages. Under the lecturer's step-by-step guidance, you will run the script using this dataset. The primary goal of this hands-on experience is to familiarize you with the basic operations of the script.

## Part 1: Experimentation Phase

### Playing with Prompts
- **Task**: Experiment with various prompts derived from the code changes in your dataset.
- **Guidance**: The lecturer will assist you in modifying these prompts and observing the resulting changes in the script's output.

### Adjusting Parameters
- **Focus**: Learn how to adjust the 'temperature' setting of the script.
- **Purpose**: This parameter controls the creativity of the generated messages. You will explore how different settings impact the style and content of the commit messages.

### Documentation
- **Importance**: Document the different commit messages generated during your experimentation.
- **Use**: This documentation will be valuable for analysis and comparison later in the tutorial.

## Part 2: Evaluating the Generated Messages

### Comparative Analysis
- **Activity**: Compare the AI-generated commit messages with human-written ones from the CSV file.
- **Analysis**: With the lecturer's assistance, focus on analyzing variations in style, tone, content, and length.
- **Insight**: This comparison will be particularly insightful in the context of the different prompts and temperature settings you have experimented with.
